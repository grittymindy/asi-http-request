This fixes occasional crash when you cancel an ASIHTTPRequest.  


The crash can be reproduced when you cancel a request that satisfies:  

  1. currently waiting in queue, not been started yet
  2. there is valid cached data for this request in downloadCache  

The fix is similar to jogu@887fcad. That's, avoid calling markAsFinished unless we're in progress.
